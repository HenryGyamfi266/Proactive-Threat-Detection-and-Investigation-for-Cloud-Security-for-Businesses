**Task1** Enabling Security Command Center API 
In order to enable the SCC API, I did the following:
1. On the google cloud console, I clicked on the Navigation menu in the top left corner of the Google Cloud console.
2. Select APIs & Services from the drop down and click on Enable APIs & Services and click + Enable APIs & Services
3. I then searched for Security Command Center API in the search box.
4. Click on Security Command Center API, then click Enable.

**Task2**-  Initiate and mitigate a threat with Event Threat Detection
The Event Threat Detection service of SCC detects many threats by monitoring suspicious activities reported in Google Cloud logs. 
One of these activities might be delegating sensitive roles to an external user, such as someone who has a miscellaneous gmail.com account that isn't tied to your corporate domain.
This might happen in situations when an intruder has managed to access a GCP organization and now they are interested in establishing persistence.
To do this, the hacker would grant sensitive roles to their @gmail.com account.This delegation simulates establishing persistence. 
If a hacker accidentally gets temporary access to Cymbal's system, they will need to establish persistence and to get access to a more stable account.
For this project, In order to initiate and mitigate the threat, I followed these processes
1. In the Google Cloud Console, I opened the navigation menu and selected IAM & Admin > IAM. Press the Grant Access button.
2. In the "New principals" field, I entered the demo email address which is = demouser1@gmail.com
3. For the Role field, I selected BigQuery > BigQuery Admin and clicked Save.
4. Open the navigation menu and select Security > Security Command Center > Findings. Changed the Time Range dropdown to the Last 6 hours.
5. Of the three Findings, I clicked on the Finding Non org IAM member and scroll down to check the "Source display name" in the description of this Finding.
6. I ensured that the display name is set to Security Health Analytics. I closed the window with the Finding.
7. I clicked on the other Finding Persistence: IAM anomalous grant and scrolled down to check the "Source display name" in the description of this Finding.
8. I ensured that the display name is set to "Event Threat Detection"â€”this is the SCC service that detected a misconfiguration in the Project.
9. I now scrolled to the top of the window and select the tab Source Properties. In this tab expand the Properties > sensitiveRoleGrant field.
10. This is where I found:
principalEmail: who performed the suspicious action
bindingDetails: information about the role and the member to whom this role has been granted
members: to whom the permission has been granted
11. Now, From the navigation menu, select IAM & Admin > IAM.
12. I now clicked the checkbox next to the demouser1@gmail.com principal and clicked the button Remove Access. Clicked Confirm
13. Now I opened the navigation menu and select Security > Security Command Center > Findings.
Observation
I noted that the Findings "Non org IAM member" has disappeared from the list of findings. 
This is because the Security Health Analytics service has checked the updated configuration of IAM policies and deactivated this Finding.

**Task3**-Configuring a secured cloud environment to detect threats
