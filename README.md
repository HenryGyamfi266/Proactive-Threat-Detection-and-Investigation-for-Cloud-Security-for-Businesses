# Proactive-Threat-Detection-and-Investigation-for-Cloud-Security-for-Businesses

## Project Overview
In this lab, I worked with Security Command Center's (SCC) integrated threat detection services. Event Threat Detection allowed me to monitor Google Cloud logs 
for patterns that signal suspicious activities, while Container Threat Detection provided continuous monitoring of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) nodes. 
This feature analyzes detected events to determine if they should be treated as incidents. Through hands-on practice, I learned to investigate and manage common
vulnerabilities in events and virtual machines, using SCC's Event Threat Detection to surface and triage findings effectively.

## Scenario
Cymbal Bank, a leading American retail bank with over 2,000 branches across all 50 states, offers extensive debit and credit services through a robust digital platform. Founded in 1920 and acquired by Cymbal Group in 1975, the bank has prioritized modernizing both in-branch and digital customer experiences, launching a mobile app in 2014. Employing 42,000 people and generating $24 billion in revenue in 2019, Cymbal Bank is undergoing digital transformation. As a Cloud Security Engineer, my role is to implement comprehensive security by leveraging Security Command Centerâ€™s Event and Container Threat Detection on Google Cloud to monitor, detect, and proactively manage vulnerabilities in real time.

## Objectives
1. Initiate and mitigate a threat with Event Threat Detection
2. Configure a secured cloud environment to detect threats
3. Manage SCC findings with Event Threat Detection
